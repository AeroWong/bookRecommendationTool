            Hi Stranger -  <br><br>
            You're reaching the <i>about page</i> of Wisdom Trigger. <br>
            Wisdom Trigger is a story of a Wisdom Baby who has been being hatching by the Wisdomizers for years. <br><br>
            Once upon a time, <a href="/wisdombabies/aerowong">I</a>, the first baby, embarked on the journey of <i>personal development</i>.<br>
            I reached out Wisdomizers who navigate the rapids before me and has a good map to follow. <br><br>
            But they're all busy working on something important to the world... <br>
            They rejected my request to be a direct mentor and provide mentorship....... <br><br>
            Luckily, there's another type of mentor - indirect mentor. <br><br>
            Namely BOOKS! <br><br>
            <a href="/wisdomizers/jamesaltucher">One</a> of the Wisdomizers had <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/10/reinventing-yourself/" target="_blank">written</a>: You can outsource 90 percent of mentorship to books and other materials. <br>
            200 - 500 books equals one good mentor. <br><br>
            <a href="/wisdomizers/dereksivers">Another</a> Wisdomizer had even mentioned once in <a href="/wisdomizers/timferriss">another</a> Wisdomzier's <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/" target="_blank">podcast</a> that he doesn't have any mentors. <br><br>
            "Books are my mentors. Books guide almost everything that I do." He said. <br><br>
            "The stuffs I learned from books totally guides my life." He stressed the fact again. <br><br>

            So I've become a book nerd. I read hundreds of books based on the Wisdomizers' recommendations. <br>
            The wisdom in those books turned me into <a href="http://aerowong.com/about/"  target="_blank">this</a>. <br><br>
            I wouldn't have the above achievements without the book recommendations from the Wisdomizers. <br>
            So I've spent a whole month to program this little site. <br>
            I want to give back to the community by spreading the Wisdomizers' book recommendations. <br><br>
            Become a Wisdom Baby with me. One day you'll become another Wisdomizer. <br><br>
            <a href="/">Enjoy.</a> =]<br><br>
