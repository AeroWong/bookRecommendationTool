## Book Recommendations from Wisdomizers

This is a web app for people who are fond of personal development. You will find hundreds of book recommendations from intelligent people (aka Wisdomizers) to nuture your brain.

Few months ago, I had a goal to master JavaScript. I have been using JavaScript for quite a while, but I relied on the frameworks that built on top of it. Like jQuery, React, Angular, whatever framework was hot at the time, you name it.

I was able to build things, but I wanted to deepen the learning of full stack web development, particularly with JavaScript. So I took the hard way to do it. 

I followed Derek Sivers's post [How to Learn JavaScript](https://sivers.org/learn-js) and learned everything from the scratch again. I emptied my mind and unlearned everything. I pretended that I knew nothing about JS. I stopped coding from a month and just read the JavaScript books. More detail on [How to Learn JavaScript](https://sivers.org/learn-js).

Along the way, I had a number of digital product ideas. I wanted to trun the learning mode toward - learning by doing. Eventually I fell for the idea to provide book recommendations for friends.

A month later, I set aside my Anki flash cards and started to code. I used JavaScript for everything, from backend to frontend. 

Plus the server side stuffs, the following items are the components that I used.

Virtual server: [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
Web server: [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
DB: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
Backend: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [LoopBack](https://loopback.io/)
Frontend: [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

So, that was that. 

I wanted to deepen my learning in programming and be useful to my friends at the same time.
